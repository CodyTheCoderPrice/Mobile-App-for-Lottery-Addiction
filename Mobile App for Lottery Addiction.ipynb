    "# Mobile App for Lottery Addiction\n",
    "In this project, we're contributing to the development of a mobile app that's meant to help prevent lottery addition by showing gamblers their chances of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app is being developed by a medical institue which specializes in treating gambling addition. They already have a team of engineers ready to build the app, but they need us to create the logical core of the app and calculate probablities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app will be focused on the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49), where six numbers are drawn from a set of 49, and a player can win a prize by matching two or more numbers on a single ticket. The big prize of 5 million CA$ is awarded to anyone who matches all 6 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to build functions that answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play multiple tickets (example 40 tickets)?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning a lesser prize by matching between 2 to 5 winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "The scenario we're following throughout this project is fictional â€” the main purpose is to practice applying probability and combinatorics (permutations and combinations) concepts in a setting that simulates a real-world scenario."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we wrote the logic for an application allowing users to see the odds of winning the 6/49 lottery using different strategies, such as playing  one or many tickets, using historical data to see if a combination of numbers has ever won before, and trying to win a smaller prize by getting between 2 to 5 winning numbers. We hope users seeing the low chances of winning a prize will discourage them from gambling. Here are our main takeaways:\n",
    "- The chances to win the big prize with a single ticket are extremely low.\n",
    "- To have relatively high chances of winning the big prize, the player has to buy **a huge amount of tickets**.\n",
    "- The probability of having less winning numbers is still very low."
